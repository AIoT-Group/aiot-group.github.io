<b>Abstract:</b> Emotional AI and the Smart City
Building citizen-centric frameworks for emotion-recognition technology and non-conscious data collection
<br>
 
Artificial intelligence is rapidly transforming how we work and live. One of the fastest growing areas of AI development belongs to intelligent machines that can detect, read and evaluate human emotion. More commonly known by its commercial moniker, emotional AI, affect recognition technology is quickly becoming an integral layer of smart city design. Although still evolving in sophistication and complexity, emotion-sensing devices are now featured in advertising kiosks and billboards, fast food menus, public and private security systems, autonomous cars, classroom teaching aids, smart toys, home assistants, email software as well as care robots. Unlike other AI applications that are dependent on extracting data from a person’s corporeal exterior or online activities, emotional AI passes into the interior and highly subjective domain of a person via biometric means. This includes algorithms, biosensors and actuators that harvest non-conscious data gleaned from someone’s heartbeat, respiration rate, blood pressure, voice tone and word choice, body temperature, galvanic skin responses, head and eye-movement, and gait.
<br>
 
As emotional AI emerges in cities, it will have profound impacts on the daily lives of citizens. By attempting to make internal emotional states visible it raises questions about data privacy in public spaces, empathic surveillance of everyday life and how governance mechanisms should best protect civic values and rights.

<h3>BIOGRAPHY</h3><br>
<img src="/img/posts/PeterMatello.jpg" alt="PeterMatello" style="padding-left: 40%;">
<br>
Peter Mantello is a Professor of Media, Ethics and Technology at Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University, Oita Japan. His research explores the porous boundaries and feedback systems between artificial technology, security, and emerging technologies. Prior to his academic life, he worked as a war photographer in conflict zones in Burma and later as a creative director of advertising in Bangkok. Besides an expertise in emotional AI, he has published on diverse topics such as videogames, jihadist media, memes, selfies, and computational policing. He is founder of and lead researcher at ethikal.ai, a research think tank devoted to two distinct branches of artificial intelligence. The first deals with computational advances in policing, criminal justice, and the shift from post-hoc to precrime society. The second project examines the cross-cultural ethical, political, social, and philosophical dimensions of emotional artificial intelligence in smart city design.
