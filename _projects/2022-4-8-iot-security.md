Internet of Things (IoT) has been playing an important role in many sectors such as smart cities, smart agriculture,
smart healthcare, and smart manufacturing. However, IoT devices are vulnerable to cyber-attacks, which may result in
security breaches and data leakages. To effectively prevent these attacks, a variety of machine learning-based network
intrusion detection methods for IoT networks have been developed, which often rely on either feature extraction or
feature selection technique for reducing the dimension of input data before being fed to machine learning models. This
aims to make the detection complexity low enough for real-time operations, which is particularly vital in intrusion
detection systems.
